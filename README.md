# Handwritten-Recognition

## Overview
The Handwritten Recognition project is a system designed to recognize handwritten characters. The system utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically an AlexNet-based feature extractor and an SVM classifier, to perform the character recognition task.

## Features
- Handwritten character recognition using the AlexNet architecture and SVM classifier
- User-friendly interface for input and result visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/SiddhaarthG/Handwritten-Recognition.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install <module-name>`

## Usage
1. Run the src.py script file in any ipython notebook
2. In the prediction cell under image_path give the characters path in a sequential order
3. You can view the recognized word as the output

## Dataset
The system was trained on a custom dataset of handwritten characters. The dataset contains samples of various characters and was manually labeled for training the classifier.
